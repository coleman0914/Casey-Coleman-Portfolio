Pen & Box Project
 During this time, we constructed a pen and a wooden box. This process included selecting the wood, trimming it, cutting a hole, using the lathe (turner), gluing, and assembling the final pieces to complete the pen. I really enjoyed this project. However, I encountered a challenge: part of my wood broke off while I was turning it. I documented this issue, and fortunately, on the second attempt, everything went smoothly and I was able to successfully finish the pen. I learned about cutting and trimming the wood, using a bunch of different machines and turners. 

September 12 – September 18
GitHub & Version Control
 This week in class, we learned about GitHub, Git, and Visual Studio Code. I discovered how GitHub works similarly to a cloud-based folder for storing and managing code and files. It was interesting to understand the workflow between local code (in VS Code), Git (for version control), and GitHub (for cloud storage and collaboration). I’m noting this now because I hadn’t yet set up my daily journal during this period.

Initial Project Brainstorming
 Today, I began reading Make: Design for CNC to help guide my upcoming project. While I have a general idea, I still need to finalize the details in the coming days and weeks. My current idea involves creating a stool with a built-in processor to add a layer of interactivity and complexity to the project.

Project Idea Finalized
 I’ve finalized the concept for my project, which is a smart stool. The idea is to use sensors so that when someone sits or stands on it, LED lights embedded around the stool will activate and flash in a pattern. This adds both a functional and aesthetic element to the design, and it integrates CNC design with electronics.

September 28 – October 1
Owl Soldering Project
 This week I completed the owl soldering project. It was fairly simple for me since I’ve been soldering since middle school and have developed solid precision and accuracy. There were no struggles for me as I completed the project. On October 1st, I also started working on my smart stool design using a Fusion 360 tutorial to begin modeling my ideas digitally.

Material Selection & Quiz
 Today, I selected the wood I’ll use for the base of my stool. We also took a quiz in class.

October 9–10
Tools Practice & Material Confirmation
 I finalized my wood selection for the project. Additionally, during our 75-minute class period, I refreshed my skills with both the 3D printer and the laser cutter. Mr. Dubick helped me learn how to properly focus one of the laser cutters, and I practiced using it on my own afterward.

Digital Portfolio Setup
 Today, I downloaded the Jekyll template for my digital portfolio. I edited the config.yml file to add a photo path, wrote a short bio, and included a brief description of myself. My digital portfolio is now officially set up.
