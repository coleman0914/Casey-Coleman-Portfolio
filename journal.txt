8-25 through 9-12: construction of box and pen project. This involved getting our wood, trimming it down, cutting the hole inside the wood, using the turner, using glue to assemble the pen, and then assembling the final parts to get the pen working. I am documenting about this later on because Github had not been set up at this point. 
9-12-9-18- in class we learned about github, and I am writing about this now because I did not have my daily journal set up 9-12-9-18- in class we learned about github, and I am writing about this now because I did not have my daily journal set up

Ocotober 9th and 10th- I found the wood that I will use for my p[roject, and along with that in our 75 minute period on friday I refreshed my skills of the 3d printer and laser cutter by printing and cutting. (I learned how to focus one of the laser cutters with mr. dubick's help, and then I used what he taught me to practice focusing the cutter on my own.  )
